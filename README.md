# More Picks & Points: Traits|Civics|Ethics [FLEX EDITION]

Welcome to the Flex Script for the Stellaris Mod "More Picks & Points: Traits|Civics|Ethics [FLEX EDITION]". This script allows you to customize the mod settings without manually editing the configuration files.

## Features:

- **Automatic Mod Path Detection**: The script tries to automatically detect the mod's path on your system.
  
- **Customization**: Choose between vanilla, standard (mod default), or custom settings. The script will then modify the mod files accordingly.
  
- **User-Friendly**: No need to manually edit configuration files. Just answer the script's prompts!

- **Standalone Executable**: For ease of use, a standalone `.exe` version is available, allowing users to run the customization tool without needing Python installed.

## How to Use:

1. Download the `flexScript_easy.exe` from the release section.
  
2. Double-click to run the executable. A terminal window will open with on-screen prompts.
  
3. Follow the prompts to customize your mod settings.
  
4. Once finished, close the terminal window and enjoy the game with your personalized settings!

### Python Script (For advanced users):
